				Children's Term Rider, which is available to children ages 14 days to 20 years.
				Benefit amounts are $5,000 to $30,000 per child. The premium for the rider does not change when additional children are added.
				The IAC Children's Term Rider also has a value added conversion privilege.
				This allows rider holding young adults between the ages of 20 to 25 to exercise their conversion option.
				Each insured child may convert to a new permanent policy (with no evidence of insurability) for an amount up to 10 times the Term Rider to a maximum of $150,000.
				In addition, one will find a 20% discount on the converted policy for the first five policy years.
