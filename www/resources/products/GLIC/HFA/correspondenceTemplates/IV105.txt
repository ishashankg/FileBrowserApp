RE:  $policyNumber - $correspondenceAppName

Dear $correspondenceOwnerName:

Thank you for selecting Gerber Life for your insurance needs.  We appreciate the opportunity to serve you.

If coverage currently held by the proposed insured will be modified or changed by a new contract, the policy cannot be issued since it is Gerber Life's practice not to engage in replacement transactions.  Therefore, we have closed the processing of your application and included a full refund if money was sent with your application.

Your confidence in Gerber Life is appreciated and we do regret this action is necessary.  If you have any questions or wish to obtain a Gerber Life policy that will not affect your existing coverage, please call us Toll Free at 1-855-265-1979 for assistance.
