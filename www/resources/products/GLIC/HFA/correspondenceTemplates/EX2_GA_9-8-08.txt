REPLACING YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY? 
Are you thinking about buying a new policy and discontinuing or changing an existing policy? If you are, your decision could be a good one -- or a mistake. You will not know for sure unless you make a careful comparison of your existing policy and the proposed policy. 
Make sure you understand the facts. Georgia law gives you the right to obtain a policy summary statement from your existing insurer at any time. Ask the company or agent that sold you your existing policy to give you information about it. 
Do not let one agent or insurer prevent you from obtaining information from another agent or insurer which may be to your advantage. 
Hear both sides before you decide. This way you can be sure you are making a decision that is in your best interest. 

[    ]    If you wish a policy summary statement from your existing insurer, or insurers, check this box. 

We are required to notify your existing company that you may be replacing their policy.
