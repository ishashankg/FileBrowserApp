Dear $correspondenceOwnerName,

We regret to inform you that your recent application for an annuity is being declined and your funds will be returned.
Upon review of your application and the paperwork included appointing $freeForm_RICHTEXT as your Durable Power of Attorney, we found that the Power of Attorney document does not specifically grant $freeForm_RICHTEXT the power to purchase insurance/annuities or to designate himself as a beneficiary.  We encourage you to discuss this matter with your agent. 
If you need any additional assistance from Fidelity & Guaranty Life, please contact Policyholder Services at 1-800-445-6758.  Our service professionals are ready to assist you Monday through Friday from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm CST.

Sincerely,

Policyholder Services
