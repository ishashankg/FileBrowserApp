				<paragragh  text="b. Cash Surrender Value: This is the amount of money you can get if you surrender your life insurance policy or annuity.

Not all policies have cash surrender values." styleClass="groupParagraph" >

				<paragragh  text="c. Lapse: A life insurance policy may lapse when you do not pay the premiums within the grace period. If your policy had a cash surrender value, the insurer might change your policy to as much extended term insurance or paid-up insurance as the cash surrender value will buy. Sometimes the policy lets the insurer borrow from the cash surrender value to pay the premiums." styleClass="groupParagraph">

				<paragragh  text="f. Borrow Policy Loan Values: If your life insurance policy has a cash surrender value, you can usually borrow all or part of said amount from the insurer. Interest will be charged according to the terms of the policy, and if the loan and unpaid interest ever exceeds the cash surrender value the policy will be terminated. If you die, the amount of the loan and any unpaid interest due will be subtracted from the death benefits."  styleClass="groupParagraph">

Incontestable Clause: This says that after one (1) or two (2) years, according to the provisions of the contract, the insurer shall not resist a claim because you made a false or incomplete statement when you applied for the policy.
