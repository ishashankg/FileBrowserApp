Dear $agentFirstName $agentLastName:

We are in the process of reviewing the annuity application you recently submitted as referenced above. Before we can process this application further, we have questions that will need your attention based on information on the Suitability Acknowledgment Form (SAF). This is not meant to suggest there is anything wrong necessarily but clarification is needed in order to continue with our suitability review.

Please attend to this as quickly as possible. Once you provide the requested information, we can then proceed with our suitability review and processing of the application. If we still need additional information based on your answers to our questions below, we may contact you again.

Please note this application will remain in NIGO (Not in Good Order) status until this information is received from you. If we do not receive the information within ten days, the application will be declined.

Please provide the following additional information:

The Suitability Acknowledgement Form indicates that cash value from a life insurance policy will be used to purchase this annuity. Please provide a detailed explanation as to how this replacement is consistent with the financial and insurance needs of your client. Include any relevant information about the type of life insurance policy being replaced, the face amount of the replaced policy, scheduled premiums, cost of insurance, other life insurance owned by the client, the insured’s overall health, changes in financial objectives, and any other information that might help us in our suitability review. If possible, please also provide a current statement and in-force policy illustration.

As indicated above, we need you to provide this information as soon as possible, so we may proceed with review of this application. Please understand that there could be additional questions – even after we get your answers to these questions – but we are committed to moving as quickly as possible consistent with our obligation to perform a suitability review as required by law and dictated by good sales practices.

If you have questions or concerns, you may call us toll-free at 1-800-445-6758.

Sincerely,


Annuity New Business Department
