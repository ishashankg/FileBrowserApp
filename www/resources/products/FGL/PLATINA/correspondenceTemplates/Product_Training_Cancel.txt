Dear $agentFirstName $agentLastName,

The annuity application submitted on behalf of the above referenced applicant has been rejected.  Our records indicate that your Company required product training on this Fidelity & Guaranty Life annuity product series has not been completed.  
This in no way implies that you are not knowledgeable about our products and we appreciate your business.  However, as indicated in compliance bulletins, Fidelity & Guaranty Life has implemented the revised NAIC Model Regulation on Suitability in Annuity Transactions which includes this formalized on-line product training and certification.  
Please log on to Saleslink to complete the required product specific training.  Once you complete the training, you will be asked to complete an on-line certification evidencing satisfaction of this requirement.   
A letter has been sent to the applicant advising that this application was not accepted, with a refund of any premium submitted with the application.
Once you have completed the product training and the on-line certification, we hope you will submit a new application for your client.  
Should you have any questions, you can find more information on Saleslink or contact our New Business Department at 1-800-445-6758. 

Sincerely,

Annuity New Business Department
