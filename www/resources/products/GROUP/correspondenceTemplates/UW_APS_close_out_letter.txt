RE:  $policyNumber - $correspondenceAppName

Dear $correspondenceOwnerName:

Thank you for your interest in Gerber Life Insurance.  We have received your application and feel you made a wise decision in applying for coverage.

Based on the information received, a copy of your current medical records would be required to evaluate your eligibility for coverage.  We are unable to continue processing your application without this information and the application is therefore being closed.

If you would like to obtain a copy of your current medical records and submit them to us, we would be happy to review them and reconsider you for coverage at that time.  Unfortunately, we are not able to reimburse for any costs associated with obtaining medical records.

Again, thank you for your interest and if you have any questions, please call us toll free at 1-800-253-3074.
