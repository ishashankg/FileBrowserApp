        <paragragh

        <paragragh
            text="4. Don't terminate or alter your existing policy until after the new policy has been delivered to you and accepted by you."

        <paragragh
            text="5. REMEMBER: Following receipt of a new life insurance policy or annuity contract you should immediately examine its contents. If you are not satisfied with it for any reason, you have the right to return it within the twenty (20) day &quot;examination period&quot; to the insurer at its home office or branch office or to the agent through whom it was purchased, for a full refund of premium. If you do not return the policy or contract, you should request a dated receipt indicating that it was returned."
