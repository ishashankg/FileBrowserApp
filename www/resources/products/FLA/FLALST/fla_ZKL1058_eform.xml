				<paragragh
					text="You have indicated that you intend to replace existing life insurance or annuity coverage in connection with the purchase of our life insurance or annuity policy. As a result, we are required to send you this notice. Please read it carefully."
					styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
				<paragragh
					text="Whether it is to your advantage to replace your existing insurance or annuity coverage, only you can decide. It is in your best interest however, to have adequate information before a decision to replace your present coverage becomes final so that you may understand the essential features of the proposed policy and of your existing insurance or annuity coverage."
					styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
				<paragragh
					text="You may want to contact your existing life insurance or annuity company or its agent for additional information and advice or discuss your purchase with other advisors. Your existing company will provide this information to you. The information you receive should be of value to you in reaching a final decision."
					styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
				<paragragh
					text="If either the proposed policy or the existing insurance you intend to replace is a participating policy you should be aware that dividends may materially reduce the cost of insurance and are an important factor to consider. Dividends, however, are not guaranteed."
					styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
				<paragragh
					text="You should also recognize that a policy which has been in existence for a period of time may have certain advantages to you over a new policy. If the policy coverages are basically similar, the premiums for a new policy may be higher because rates increase as your age increases. Under your existing policy, the period of time during which the issuing company could contest the policy because of a material misrepresentation or omissions concerning the medical information requested in your application, or deny coverage for death caused by suicide, may have expired or may expire earlier than it will under the proposed policy. Your existing policy may have options which are not available under the policy being proposed to you or may not come into effect under the proposed policy until a later time during your life. Also, your proposed policy's cash values and dividends, if any, may grow slower initially because the company will incur the cost of issuing your new policy. On the other hand, the proposed policy may offer advantages which are more important to you."
					styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
				<paragragh
					text="If you are considering borrowing against your existing policy to pay the premiums on the proposed policy, you should understand that in the event of your death the amount of the unpaid loan, including unpaid interest, will be deducted from the benefits of your existing policy thereby reducing your total insurance coverage."
					styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
				<paragragh
					text="After we have issued your policy, you will have 20 days from the date the new policy is received by you to notify us you are cancelling the policy issued on your application and you will receive back all payments you made to us."
					styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
				<paragragh
					text="You are urged not to take action to terminate or alter your existing life insurance or annuity coverage until you have been issued the new policy, examined it and have found it acceptable to you."

					text="A transaction in which a new policy or contract is to be purchases, and it is known or should be known to the proposing agent or insurer, that by reason of the transaction, an existing policy or contract has been or is to be: lapsed, forfeited, surrendered or partially surrendered, annuitized, assigned to the replacing insurer or otherwise reduced in value by the use of non-forfeiture benefits or other policy values; amended so as to effect either a reduction in benefits or in the term for which coverage would otherwise remain in force or for which benefits would be paid; reissued with any reduction in cash value; or used in a 'financed purchase.' 'Financed Purchase' means the purchase of a new policy or contract involving the actual or intended use of funds obtained by the withdrawal, surrender of or borrowing from an existing policy or contract to pay all or part of any premium or consideration due to the new policy or contract."

An external replacement is when a Fidelity Life Association policy or contract is replaced by another insurer; or a Fidelity Life Association policy or contract replaces a policy or contract of another insurer."
