Your existing policy may have options which are not available under the policy being proposed to you or may not come into effect under the proposed policy until a later time during your life. Also, your proposed policy's cash values and dividends, if any, may grow slower initially because the company will incur the cost of issuing your new policy. On the other hand, the proposed policy may offer advantages which are more important to you."
