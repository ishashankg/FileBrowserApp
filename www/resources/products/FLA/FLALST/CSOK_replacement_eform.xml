            text="It may not be advantageous to drop or change existing life insurance in favor of new life insurance, whether issued by the same or a different insurance company. Some of the disadvantages are:"
            styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
        <paragragh
            text="*  The amount of the annual premium under an existing policy may be lower than that under a new policy having the same or similar benefits."
            styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
        <paragragh
            text="*  Generally, the initial costs of life insurance policies are charged against the cash value increases in the earlier policy years, the replacement of an old policy could result in the policyholder sustaining the burden of these costs twice."
            styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
        <paragragh
            text="*  The incontestable and suicide clauses begin anew in a new policy. This could result in a claim under a new policy being denied by the company which would have been paid under the old policy."
            styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
        <paragragh
            text="*  Existing policies may have more favorable provisions than new policies in such areas as settlement options and disability benefits."

        <paragragh
            text="*  An existing policy may have a reserve value in addition to any cash value which may be of some benefit to the insured."
            styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
        <paragragh
            text="*  The insurance company carrying your current insurance policy can often make a desired change on terms which would be more favorable than if existing insurance is replaced with new insurance."

        <paragragh
            text="It may not be advantageous to change an existing policy to reduced paid-up or extended term insurance or to borrow against its loan value beyond your expected ability or intention to repay in order to obtain funds for premiums on a new policy."

        <paragragh
            text="Premiums: Premiums are the payments you make on the life insurance or annuity contract. They are unlike deposits in a savings or investment program, because if you drop the policy, you might get back less than you paid in."
            styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
        <paragragh
            text="Cash Surrender Value: This is the amount of money you can get in cash if you surrender your life insurance policy or annuity. If there is a policy loan, the cash surrender value is the difference between the cash value printed in the policy and the loan value. Not all policies have cash surrender values."
            styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
        <paragragh
            text="Lapse: A life insurance policy may lapse when you do not pay the premium within the grace period. If your policy had a cash surrender value, the insurer might change your policy to as much extended term insurance or paid-up insurance as the cash surrender value will buy. Sometimes the policy lets the insurer borrow from the cash surrender value to pay the premiums."
            styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
        <paragragh
            text="Surrender: You surrender a life insurance policy when you either let it lapse or tell the company you want to drop it. If a policy has a cash surrender value, you can receive such value in cash if you return the policy to the company with a written request."
            styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
        <paragragh
            text="Place on Extended Term: This means you use your cash surrender value to change your insurance to term insurance with the same insurer. In this case, the net benefit will be the same as before, but you will only be covered for a specified period of time."
            styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
        <paragragh
            text="Borrow Policy Loan Values: If your life insurance policy has a cash surrender value, you can usually borrow all or part of said amount from the insurer. Interest will be charged according to the terms of the policy, and if the loan with unpaid interest ever exceeds the cash surrender value, the policy will be terminated. If you die, the amount of the loan and any unpaid interest due will be subtracted from the death benefits."
            styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
        <paragragh
            text="Evidence of Insurability: This means proof that you are an acceptable risk. You have to meet the standards of the insurer regarding age, health, occupation, and such other standards as the insurer feels are necessary to be eligible for coverage."
            styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
        <paragragh
            text="Incontestable Clause: This says that after one (1) or two (2) years, according to the provisions of the contract, the insurer shall not resist a claim because you made a false or incomplete statement when you applied for the policy. During the first two (2) years if there are false or incomplete answers on the application and the insurer discovers them, the insurer can deny a claim as if the policy has never existed."
            styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
        <paragragh
            text="Suicide Clause: This says that if you commit suicide after being insured for less than two (2) years, your beneficiaries will receive only a refund of the premiums that were paid."
