RE:  $policyNumber

Dear $correspondenceAppName:

During the application process, we gave you a written description of the Medical Information Bureau, a consumer reporting agency which operates an information exchange.  MIB will arrange disclosure of any information it may have in your file.  When we evaluated your application, the MIB sent a brief, coded report about you to us as you authorized in your application.           
                                                                              
Your application for insurance was declined in whole or in part because of information obtained in the investigation conducted as a result of the MIB report we received.                                                       
                                                                          
Our decision to decline your application is being provided under separate cover.      
                                                                                                                                            
You may obtain a summary of your MIB report at no charge if you contact MIB within 60 days of this date.
