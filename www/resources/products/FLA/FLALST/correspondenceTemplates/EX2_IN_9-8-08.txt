IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING REPLACEMENT OF LIFE INSURANCE
You are thinking about DISCONTINUING or CHANGING an existing life insurance policy or annuity contract and BUYING a replacement. Your decision could be a good one -- or possibly a mistake. Make sure that you understand the facts. You should: 
* Make a careful comparison of your existing policy and the proposed policy before you make a final decision. 
* Ask the company or agent that sold you your existing policy to provide you with complete information about it. 
* Determine what you want your insurance program to do. 
* Consider your present health. You may have had a change which could affect your insurability, so make sure to continue your present policy until a new policy is delivered to you and accepted by you. 
You have the right, within thirty days after delivery of a replacement policy, to return it to the company and to claim an unconditional refund of all premiums paid on it. 
Indiana Department of Insurance Regulation, 760 IAC 1-16.1 requires that the company making the replacement notify your existing insurance company that you may be replacing your existing policy.
