Dear $correspondenceAppName:

Thank you for your interest in applying for life insurance with Gerber Life.

It was indicated on your application that you intend to either cancel or change your existing policy.  By law, we are required to provide you with the attached notice to assist in determining if this option is in your best interest.

We will be glad to continue processing your application as soon as you sign, date and return  the 'Replacement Notice' form.  A postage-paid return envelope is provided for your convenience.

Receipt of your response would be appreciated within 14 days from the date of this letter...if not, your application process will be discontinued.

Again, we certainly appreciate your continued interest in Gerber life and hope that we can be of service to you.  If you have any questions, please call us at 1-855-265-1979.  One of our Customer Service Representatives will be glad to help.
