					text="You are contemplating the purchase of a life insurance policy or annuity contract.  In some cases this purchase may involve discontinuing or changing an existing policy or contract.  If so, a replacement is occurring.  Financed purchases are also considered replacements."

				<paragragh
					text="A replacement occurs when a new policy or contract is purchased and, in connection with the sale, you discontinue making premium payments on the existing policy or contract, or an existing policy or contract is surrendered, forfeited, assigned to the replacing insurer, or otherwise terminated or used in a financed purchase."

				<paragragh
					text="A financed purchase occurs when the purchase of a new life insurance policy involves the use of funds obtained by the withdrawal or surrender of or by borrowing some or all of the policy values, including accumulated dividends, of an existing policy to pay all or part of any premium or payment due on the new policy.  A financed purchase is a replacement."
					styleClass="groupParagraph"></paragragh>
				<paragragh
					text="You should carefully consider whether a replacement is in your best interests.  You will pay acquisition costs and there may be surrender costs deducted from your policy or contract.  You may be able to make changes to your existing policy or contract to meet your insurance needs at less cost.  A financed purchase will reduce the value of your existing policy and may reduce the amount paid upon the death of the insured."
